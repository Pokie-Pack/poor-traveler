## Description

Motivation for this project was to provide a clear, easy-to-use, vacation package website which would allow the user to find somewhere to vacation with only just a few clicks!
We built this project so those who may not know where to find a warm or chilly specified destination would be able to find some highly recommended locations to visit with transportation and activities laid out!
The problem that this project solves is the potential tedious gesture of trying to find where to vacation when you don't have a definite place in mind already and may need help getting started.
We learned how to use React for the front-end, get more familiar with implementing models, components, and sql!

## Successes & Challenges

- Database went well, backend work, and frontend could be better
- Spelling case sensitive, confused the input the code about query to test the database on localhost 3001/graphpl.
- Setting up the typedefs file wasnâ€™t too difficult, just a few changes was needed.
- I think our biggest struggle was in the front end, getting the right wizard to work or getting the right responses from the buttons.
- also at one point, getting the server started was a problem but quickly resolved by the great john young.
- Deploying "final" version on heroku

## Features

(Currently not pushed to main branch/within heroku deployment)

- Favorites tab which will show user the travel packages they favorited so they can refer back to them
- Travel packages list should show location, price, and activities

## Future Implementations

-add the option to actually purchase a travel package with working reservations
-the ability to add reviews, maybe somehow link it through yelp

## Tests

If you git cloned and pulled the project's repo, just make sure to do "npm run seed" THEN "npm run develop" to have it run in your localhost
